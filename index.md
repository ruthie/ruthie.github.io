## About Me

I am Director of Security at [Wave](https://sendwave.com).  I'm excited by the power of software, and I want to bring that power to people who are currently less well served by it.

I graduated from MIT in 2013 with a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor in Math.  While there I helped organize [Splash](http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash), and as an alum I have volunteered for [Learning Unlimited](http://learningu.org) to help spread Splash beyond MIT.

Also I am v cute.

I love folk music (fiddle, singing) and dance (contra, English, waltz, rapper).  Some specific affiliations:
* I am an organizer of an organizer of [Next Generation Dance Camp](http://nextgendancecamp.org).  
* I dance rapper with [Harbour Steel](https://www.facebook.com/harboursteel/)
* Played fiddle with the no-longer-active contra dance band [Switching Protocols](http://switchingprotocolsband.com/)

You can hear some of my music on my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO2NxtLZCQg5GLzB4aa0_g)

I infrequently write new things, but here are my favorite blog posts, preserved for posterity.
