<h1>Blog</h1>
<p> Update 2018-11-22:  This blog is no longer updated.  I've removed posts
    that were no longer of interest or that I no longer feel proud of, which
    means I can highlight here the most interesting things I wrote.
</p>
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <h1>{{ post.title }} </h1>
    <p><b>{{ page.date | date: "%-d %B %Y"}}</b></p>
    {{post.content}}
    <a href="{{ post.url }}">See full post with comments</a>
    <hr class="divider">
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
